The script automatically detects your environment and adapts:

- **Conditional Setup** - Only configures tools that are present (Conda, Azure CLI, etc.)

## 📋 Requirements

Additional tools are installed automatically as needed.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

All operations redirect errors to stdout for easy debugging:

bash -x install.sh

# Check specific sections
bash install.sh 2>&1 | grep "ERROR\|FAIL"
```

The script provides detailed logging with context-specific messages for each installation step.
